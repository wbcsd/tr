## What is this repository?
The wbcsd/tr repository, ‘tr’ standing for ‘technical report’, holds all document releases, especially of the Technical Specifications but not only. 

## Goals of tr repository
The `tr` repository’s goals are:
* to act as a source of truth, enabling transparency and trustworthiness: community members can follow relevant updates by following this repository. Releases get a timestamp, changes from the version to version become visible for everyone. Changes to this repository cannot be made retrospectively, again turning this repository into a commitment to the community towards openness and transparency and transparent processes.

* to make releases referencable: By putting documents in this repository, they become accessible via the browser. Releases are important artefacts to community members that they rely on when developing solutions. Likewise, stable URLs become “citable” and fully referencable by others, for instance in policy documents, other standard-setting processes, etc. 

**Limitations**

Since this repository is a collection of releases, it only includes `html` and `svg` files. All files used in the generation of these are kept solely in the `wbcsd/data-exchange-protocol` repo.
